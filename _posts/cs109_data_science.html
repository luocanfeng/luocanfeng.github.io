<h2>Predicting Hubway Stations Status</h2>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>A major challenge for bicycle sharing programs like Hubway is network imbalance. Some stations are chronically empty at certain times of the day, while others are often full, forcing riders to find another, more inconvenient station at which to drop off the bike. This element of uncertainty detracts from the otherwise seamless user experience. To partially remedy this problem, Hubway uses vans to redistribute the bikes across stations each day. However, this strategy is ad hoc and haphazard. It adds to company costs and moreover detracts from the environmental benefits that Hubway offers. This problem calls for a more scientific approach to both the redistribution of bikes across stations and the provision of information to customers. We propose a new data science program that informs customers of the likelihood that either a bicycle or an empty bike dock will be available at a given station at some future point in time.
问题：网络失衡；
补救措施：人工挪车；
需求：需要一种更加科学的方法来解决资源网络失衡的问题，并为用户提供精准的信息服务；
动机：提议一个数据科学程序，告诉客户在指定的站点有空车可以租用，或者在未来的某个时间点很可能会有单车驶入并退租。
